# Spring JWT Token Creation and Security Authentication

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to create and manage **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for secure authentication in a Spring-based application. JWTs are widely used for stateless authentication, allowing users to authenticate without relying on server-side sessions.

## Features

1. **JWT Token Creation**:
   - We'll cover how to generate JWTs upon successful user login.
   - The token will contain user-specific claims (such as username, roles, and expiration time).

2. **Token Validation and Authentication**:
   - Learn how to validate incoming JWTs.
   - Implement security filters to authenticate requests based on valid tokens.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Java and Maven.
   - Set up a Spring Boot project.

2. **Clone this Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Jeet-Codes/SpringJwt.git
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - Configure your Spring Security settings in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
   - Define your secret key for JWT signing.

4. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user authentication (e.g., via username/password or OAuth2).
   - Upon successful authentication, issue a JWT.

5. **Token Validation**:
   - Create a filter to validate incoming JWTs.
   - Extract user details from the token.

6. **API Endpoints**:
   - Define protected endpoints that require valid JWTs.
   - Handle unauthorized access.

## Usage

1. **Register/Login**:
   - Register a user or log in using your preferred authentication method.
   - Receive a JWT upon successful login.

2. **Access Protected Endpoints**:
   - Include the JWT in the `Authorization` header of your requests.
   - Access protected resources (e.g., user profile, restricted APIs).

## Example Code

```java
// Example of JWT creation
String token = Jwts.builder()
    .setSubject(username)
    .claim("roles", roles)
    .setExpiration(expirationDate)
    .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS512, secretKey)
    .compact();
```
